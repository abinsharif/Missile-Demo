Missile 1: simplest with only a scenario and night mode but best crashing animation with no losses. only angle, velocity and weight changeable.
Missile 2: better with a day view and a bit more control. another good kind of explosion. everything with only one mode but a good follow camera option
Missile 3: best camera control with 3 options plus easy keyboard and mouse control. flame path animation but no impact. many choices of everything including nukes and a new perfect target system
Missile 4: Good UI but problematic code
Missile 5: New feature: destroys on impact but has some problem.
Missile 6: Worse than others in many cases, just set the angle high and velocity lowest - impact works better in city - broken camera so set follow
